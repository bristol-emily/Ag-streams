Water chemistry and dissolved GHG data collected from Rice Creek and Heath Creek, Northfield, MN, USA. Emily Bristol and Allison Herreid.

Excel documents include some data and calculations, but are not to be used with R Scripts. 

The "water-chemistry.csv" file includes all of the nutrients, GHG and YSI data. When I was a senior, I wrote up some code to graph this and analyze some of the data, included in the .Rmd file and "Stream chemistry.R". Graphs look nice, but I wouldn't trust the stats. Might be easier just to start a new script for statistics.

Haven't looked at the flux calculations recently. Included a few files here. The most useful to download and look at is probably the Excel document where I did all the calculations.
